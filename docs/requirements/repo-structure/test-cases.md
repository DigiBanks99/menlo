# Repo Scaffolding & Code Structure - Test Cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All source code is under `src/` with clear vertical slice boundaries.
- [ ] Shared libraries are under `lib/` and not duplicated in feature folders.
- [ ] UI implementations are under `ui/` and separated from domain logic.
- [ ] Aspire AppHost and service defaults are present and referenced in documentation.
- [ ] New features can be added as new vertical slices without breaking existing code.
- [ ] The structure matches the [Architecture Document](../../explanations/architecture-document.md#code-organization-structure) and [C4 Code Diagram](../../diagrams/c4-code-diagram.md).
- [ ] All changes to structure are reflected in documentation and diagrams.
- [ ] Tests and documentation are co-located with the code they cover.
