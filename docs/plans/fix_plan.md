# Fix Plan

> This file is maintained by Ralph. Run `ralph.sh plan` to regenerate from scratch.

## How This File Works

- **Priority Items**: Work to be done, sorted by importance
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on (should be 0-1 items)
- **Completed**: Recently finished items (clean up periodically)

## Maintenance Rules

1. When this file exceeds 100 items, trigger cleanup:
   - Remove all completed items
   - Consolidate duplicate/related items
   - Re-prioritize remaining work

2. When encountering bugs during implementation:
   - Add to Priority Items FIRST
   - Then spawn subagent to fix

3. Format for items:
   - `- [ ]` Pending
   - `- [x]` Completed
