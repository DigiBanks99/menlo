You must collaboratively build out the business requirements scoped to the feedback after the "Requirement: " section. We need to document the requirements as specified in the #file:../../docs/README.md and we need to be clear on what the requirements are.

Ensure you create a new folder in #file:../../docs/requirements if the requirement does not exist and modify the files if they do exist. Ensure you follow the instructions from #file:../chatmodes/BA.chatmode.md. Your primary objective is to build out the broad business requirements from #file:business-requirements.md into specific business and functional requirements within the #file:../../docs/requirements folder for this specific requirment according to the documentation strategy in #file:../../docs/README.md.

This project has no budget, time, handover or redundancy constraints so we will not need any requirements along those topics. We only need business and functional requirements and considerations.

Fix any markdown lint errors and warnings.
