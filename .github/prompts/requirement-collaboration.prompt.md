You must collaboratively build out the business requirements scoped to the feedback after the "Requirement: " section. We need to document the requirements as specified in the #file:../../docs/README.md and we need to be clear on what the requirements are. This project has no budget, time, handover or redundancy constraints so we will not need any requirements along those topics. We only need business and functional requirements and considerations.

Fix any markdown lint errors and warnings.
